#  Violence Detection using Surveillance Video

A computer vision project that detects violent activity in surveillance videos using deep learning and video frame analysis.

##  Project Objective
To develop a model capable of identifying violent actions in video feeds, enabling smart surveillance systems to respond in real time.

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Pre-trained CNN (optional)

##  Workflow
1. Load and read video frames from surveillance footage
2. Preprocess frames (resize, normalize)
3. Feed frames to a CNN-based model
4. Predict and alert if violence is detected

##  File Overview
- `Violence_Detection_Template.ipynb`: Starter notebook with basic code flow
- `model.h5` *(to be added)*: Pre-trained model for violence classification
- `surveillance.mp4` *(to be added)*: Example input video

##  How to Run
1. Upload a video file (e.g. `surveillance.mp4`)
2. Load the trained model
3. Run prediction loop on video frames
4. Output alerts when violence is detected

##  Note
This is a template. You need to add:
- Your trained model (`.h5`)
- Sample videos (`.mp4`)
